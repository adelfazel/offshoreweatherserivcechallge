Please note; for writing average results, if the final 'batch' of records contains less than
the total amount, the avearge of remaining records will displayed. 
Input data is assumed to be valid, especially there is no check that the records are not one 
minute apart. However the script is resilient when time formatting is different and v-comp or 
u-comp are not floats.
